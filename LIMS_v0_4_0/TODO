## List for DB - First Draft due by 3/4
1. Workflow module (reduced to 4 main apps in case LIMS breaksdown; preliminary by 2/4)
    + Tables/Models ()
        - Samples + Storage
        - Libraries
            - pools
            - pooling
        - Sequencing
            - submission
            - pool
            - results
                - lane
                - sample
    + Relationships
        - (1:1) Samples --> Storage (could be one app/model, but separating allows future development and is intuitively separate operation)
        - (1:N) Samples --> Libraries
        - (1:N) Library --> PoolingAmount
        - (1:N) Pool --> PoolingAmount
        - (N:N) PoolingAmount --> WUSLaneResults
        - (1:N) WUSSubmission --> WUSLaneResults
        - (1:1) Samples --> WUSSampleResults (QC results are different after pooling lanes)

    + Forms (made generic class based views 4/8, now need to inherit to specific class based views)
        - Sample
            - Browser/List View
            - Create View
                - Required
                - Detailed
            - Update View
                - update record info
                - move samples
                - update status
                    - receive
                    - change volumes
                    - discard
            - Delete
                - should be restricted and only apply with duplicates and/or records made in error
        - Libraries
            - Plate
            - QC
            - Pooling
        - Sequencing
            - submission
            - results
                - by lane ()
                - by sample ()
    + Reports
2. Project management (preliminary by 3/4)
    + Tables
        - Projects
        - Cost Estimates
        - Expenditures
        - Funding
    + Relationships
        - (1:N) Cost Estimates --> Projects
        - (1:N) Funding --> Projects
        - (1:N) Expenditures --> Project
    + Forms
    + Reports
        - Estimates
        - Bill

3. Integration (Preliminary by 3/4)
    + Tables
        - LibrariesInProject
    + Relationships

    + Forms
        - Add "samples" to project
    + Reports
        - Project Status
        - Flow Counts
        - Project Cost versus expenditures
